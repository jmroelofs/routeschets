This is a Joomla-based solution for making route sketches in climbing competitions.

It makes paper unnecessary and automates the numbering. An iPad is sufficient.
Make a picture of the route, place it in a Joomla article with the code embedded,
and you're ready to start nummbering the holds.

As long as you are logged in and have edit rights, you can edit the sketch.
When logged out, you'll see the sketch like the rest of the world and cannot
modify it.

Use the sketch as a means for scoring, or show it on screen during a competition.
